What is an ARG?
ARG stands for Alternate Reality Game.

An ARG usually uses real-world clues to take players on a journey outside of any traditional entertainment medium. ARGs often consist of a trail of clues spread between the real world and the virtual world; for instance, an ARG may include real websites for fictitious companies, phone numbers that players can call to speak to ARG characters, or geocaches hidden in the physical world. ARGs are typically stumbled upon accidentally, with no direct confirmation by its organizer (or 'puppet-master'). These clues often include various puzzles and cryptography.

In the context of video games, ARGs often include information surrounding a game or its plot. Sometimes certain clues can only be found in-game, or 'obscure' websites.

Although purists may argue that all ARGs must follow very strict guidelines to be referred to as such, the term is commonly used to describe any cross-media meta game through which players progress based on solving a series of clues.
