      <h1>AutoMorphology</h1>
      <p>
        AutoMorphology is a detailed graphical study focusing on distinct automotive styles and designs. The project is characterized by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Graphic Design:</strong> Posters designed similarly to trading cards, each depicting a specific automotive style with precise characteristics.</li>
        <li><strong>Content:</strong> Detailed illustrations and descriptions of vehicle styles such as Baja-bug, Hotrod, Campervan, and others.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Approach:</strong> Employs a clinical, systematic methodology to present automotive design trends and styles.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each graphic provides a pseudo-scientific classification of automotive aesthetics and design, reflecting a structured examination of various vehicle types.
